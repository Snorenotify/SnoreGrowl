# SnoreGrowl
=========

SnoreGrowl is a fork of [gntp-send](https://github.com/mattn/gntp-send]) which is a command line tool for sending Growl notifications.
In difference to gntp-send the focus of this project lies on the libraries and not on the command line tool.

Contained is a C library for Growl notifications and a C++ wrapper.

Remote hosts are supported but the only encryption algorithm supported is md5.

## Platforms
---------

Sending notifications from Windows/Linux/ Mac is supported. Unixes in general should be supported but are untested.

Notifications may be received by Growl on Mac or GrowlForWindows on Windows.
